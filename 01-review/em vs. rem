em --> the width of 'm' character, will be different for different tag 

rem --> rem values are relative to the root html element, 
        not to the parent element. 
        That is, If font-size of the root element is 16px then 1 rem = 16px for all elements. 
        If font-size is not explicitly defined in root element then 1rem will be equal to 
        the default font-size provided by the browser (usually 16px)

px --> it is fixed, and not recommended to use for design
